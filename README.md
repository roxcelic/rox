# hiii,

This is the newest version of my site, and I'm personally really happy with this one. I think it's going to stay for a long while. This version of the site uses APIs and other really cool JS things to give the most user-based experience, and I will try my hardest to fix every bug as soon as possible. This site also makes use of Astro tech that I had been somewhat aware of, but I had no clue how to use. For example, the sites now order descendingly. I have also made use of my OneDrive subscription, and the items in the `fun` section have their images hosted on OneDrive. This will hopefully save on load time and space on the site's repo! This site also allows for deeper integration between it and my own personal social medias!

# thanks for listening!
