# WELCOME

This is my odd little thing. Being honest, I sink way too much time into making, and then remaking, and then remaking my website.
With this version, I'm hoping I have made it well enough to keep me occupied for a while.
But enough about me, behold me!

What's up with this website, you might be thinking? Why does it keep changing?
(Other than me remaking it) the website changes which card it shows below this, and most of said cards display data
taken from my own personal [API](https://github.com/roxcelic/api). Using a Cloudflare worker, I can display data I normally cannot.
Like what I'm currently listening to, my Spotify username and profile picture, my top Spotify pinned playlist, and the coolest, in my opinion,
embed the playlist of the song I'm currently listening to below it! You can read more about this website and the API on my blog.
But for now...

## ENJOY
