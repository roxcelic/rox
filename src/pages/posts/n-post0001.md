### hey!

So, if you've been watching me for a while then you'd notice that a lot of the blogs are gone.
Thats because I deleted them because I felt like they didnt show how I wanted the blogs to be used
and after all my updates to the blog page I want it to be used properly.<br>
Theres so much I have planned for the near future, but I just have to make it though highschool first
not too long left haha. 

why does the website keep changing?

the simple answer is that i am increadibly indeciseive, i cant keep my mind on how i want to do somthing
for a long time. Also im learning js so theres gonna be a lot more of my messing about with it on the way.

what about blog posts?

Im planning on making one big one weekly which will explain what my plans are for that week, but its still 
a flexable plan so dont think on that too heavy. Its because i have things like my GCSEs to keep me busy.

what are the plans for the next week?

I'm planning on changing some of the images used in this site and re-writing old blog posts so I can put them back 
on the site and theres not just a large gap. In a way that makes them actually look nice though

see you soon - rox
