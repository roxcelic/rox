#### Hey
I'm starting again on my game, I know I keep mentioning it but now it has a plan and its properly being started on
and I can promise I will keep working on it.

the base idea: its gonna be a 2d platformer which focuses on rhythm, whats more YOU MAKE YOUR OWN SONGS!
the plot im not gonna say much about, but it holds a lot of meaning to me and is geuinly pretty deep and i gotta say awesome. Its gonna have a lot of
learning to love yourself if that makes any sense, I have a whole plan dont worry haha

when to expect it: never, im really bad at focusing on things for a long time so after the last 2 weeks of constant work on it dont expect much updates unless I
can keep up with myself, which i will try to.

anyways, there will 100% be more to come but for now. Thank you and goodbye!
