# new

Ive become very bored of my old website layout recenetly so i fully just changed everything, branding n all.
we even got an actual icon now, it has taken a fair bit of inspo from the minecraft popy (if you couldnt tell lmao)
but i like this one a lot more, it feels a lot more free and less cluttered

# old

so ive gone through and re made my whole website today, just because i know well knew i could do it way better and i really think i have.
Theres so much less clutter in the code, it just looks better and loads faster as well as a tonn of better code practice. You can now comment
on blog posts using a bot called [giscus](https://giscus.app/), which im not yet fully familar with how it works but it looks really impressive.
and it means i can get feedback from everyone, i also added a writedate to all blog posts. The earliest date youll see is today but i want to start
writing posts in advance so there will be a difference between the day it was published and the day it was written. Thats all, byeeee.
