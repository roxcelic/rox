Hii, I'm roxanne you might know me by a lot of names. I'm good at making em bad at keeping em, but theres a lot more to me than my upfront lack of commitment.
I'm a soso game dev, but I'm a fast learner and someone whos managed to improve a lot over the past few weeks and I have no doubt i will continue to improve. Ive got a long
way to go but im proud of how far Ive come. If youve come to my website at this point im sure you know me personally but I'm glad you care enough to check on what
Ive made. For anyone else who doesnt know

im **roxie** a 16 year old developer, I make what I like when i feel like it right now so dont expect much consistancy. But what i make
has all my effort put into it and Id like you to see some of that, so please go check out my [projects](/projects/)
